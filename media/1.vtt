00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.500
All right guys so in this section we're going to get started with the dorm now up to this point we've

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.510
been learning the main fundamentals of javascript we we've been doing you know working with the console

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.710
looking at things like conditionals variables arrays.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.340
These are the building blocks of the language and they are critical.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.980
But now we're going to get to actually use this stuff in combination with the browser with with the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.990
dorm.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.330
All right.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.760
So what is the dorm it stands for the document object model.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.160
And it's basically a structured representation of an HMO document.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.240
It can be thought of kind of as a tree of nodes or elements created by the browser.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.470
OK and when I say node or element I mean in any of the each team all tags each time I'll tag the body

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.460
tag each one's pretty much anything that is in the document.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.800
And we can use javascript to manipulate these DOM Elements or nodes.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.320
The Dom is object oriented meaning that each node has its own set of properties and methods that we

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860
can change we can add we can remove.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.320
You may have seen diagrams like this one right here.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.970
Now the browser gives us a window object and inside that we have a document object.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.610
OK.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.040
And this represents just that the loaded document or web page and then we have a root element underneath

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.490
that which is the H team l tag and are the each element.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.850
Then from there we have body tags and we have a head tag and body tag which are actually siblings you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.700
can see they're on the same level in this tree.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.520
And then in the head we have things like metal tags we have our title in the body we have of course

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.780
our output which is you know H-1 tags and links and each team of five semantic header tags for tags

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.070
things like that.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.450
So if you are not too familiar with javascript but you've built each team all pages with some CSSA then

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.110
this probably looks very familiar.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.250
You're just thinking it's an H team l page but what you probably don't know is that we can manipulate

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.300
this stuff with javascript OK pretty easily and there are libraries like Jay Querrey which technically

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.940
make it a little bit easier but it's really worth learning how to do this stuff with phenolic javascript

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.060
especially now with queries selector and you can do things pretty much just as easily as you would with

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.540
a query as far as Dom selection and manipulation.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.490
OK not using J.A.G. makes it faster we don't have the overhead of the extra of the extra library so

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.120
it's definitely worth learning.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.930
One of the analogies that I like is that when you use a query to select elements from the DOM it's kind

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.890
of like using a sledgehammer to kill a mosquito.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.230
All right.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.450
So we won't be using Jay queery in this course.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140
It's going to be strictly vanilla javascript.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.000
Now what I want to do in the next video is i want to take a look at this object right here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.350
The document object.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.460
OK so this has just a ton of different methods and properties and stuff attached to it.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.890
So we're going to just go ahead and console logs just a bunch of stuff from this just so we can take

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.390
a look at what it contains.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.030
And then after that we'll move on to the different ways to select things from the DOM switches document

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.970
dot get element by id and using our query selectors things like that.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.280
All right.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.940
So I will see you in the next video.
